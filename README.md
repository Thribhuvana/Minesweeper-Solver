🚀 **An AI-powered tool that intelligently plays Minesweeper using logical reasoning, constraint satisfaction, and probability analysis.**  

## 🌟 **Overview**  
Minesweeper Solver is an **AI-based program** that plays Minesweeper intelligently. It scans the board, determines safe moves, and flags mines using logical deduction and probability-based techniques.  

🧠 **Key Highlights:**  
✅ Automatically plays Minesweeper without human input.  
✅ Uses **constraint satisfaction** and **probability calculations** to find the best moves.  
✅ Works on **various grid sizes** and handles complex game situations.  
✅ Supports **interactive & fully automated modes** for maximum flexibility.  

## 🔍 **How It Works**  
📌 **Step 1:** **Board Analysis** – The AI scans the board and detects available moves.  
📌 **Step 2:** **Logical Deduction** – Applies Minesweeper rules to determine safe cells and flag mines.  
📌 **Step 3:** **Probability Calculation** – If needed, the AI calculates the safest move using probabilities.  
📌 **Step 4:** **Game Progression** – Repeats the process until the game is won or lost.
